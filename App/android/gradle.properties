# Set JVM arguments for the Gradle Daemon
# -Xmx8G:           Sets the maximum Java heap size to 8 Gigabytes. This is a large amount,
#                   ensure your build machine has enough available RAM (e.g., 16GB+ recommended).
#                   This was likely increased to address previous "daemon disappeared" errors.
# -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=4G: Sets the maximum size for Metaspace (where class metadata is stored) to 4GB.
# -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=512m: Reserves 512MB for the JVM's compiled code cache.
# -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError: Tells the JVM to generate a heap dump file if it runs out of memory,
#                                  which helps in diagnosing memory issues.
